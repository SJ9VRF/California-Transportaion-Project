## Parameter Tuning Based on the Density Point Calculation
This algorithm is used for automating and estimating parameter calculations for the nearest point count in the measurement process.


### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Choose a random point**
   - Start by selecting a random point from the dataset.

2. **Find 20 nearest points**
   - Identify the 20 nearest points to the selected random point.

3. **Select k nearest points with low variance**
   - Among the 20 nearest points, choose `k` nearest points such that their variance is less than 0.03. (Note: Ensure that the points are normalized.)

4. **Calculate density ratio**
   - Define `k` as the density ratio for each point.

5. **Compute average of KNN points**
   - Compute the average of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) points and denote it as `m`.

6. **Compute the tail and head of the line**
   - Determine the tail and head of the line segment formed by the points.

7. **Calculate number of points**
   - Calculate the number of points using the formula:
     ```
     Number of points = |head - tail| / (m * k)
     ```

8. **Repeat and average**
   - Repeat the above steps for 10 points and return the average number of points.

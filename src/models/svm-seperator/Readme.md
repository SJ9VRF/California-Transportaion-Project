# Python Geometry Processing Classes

This repository contains Python classes designed for geometry processing tasks. Each class has specific functionalities related to point cloud and hyperplane operations. Please check each file for example usage. 

## Classes and Descriptions

### 1. PointCloudClassifier

- **File**: `PointCloudClassifier.py`
- **Description**: This class provides methods to determine the equation of a plane separator between two given classes in a point cloud dataset.
- **Result Visualisation**:

### 2. HyperplaneOperations
- **File**: `HyperplaneOperations.py`
- **Description**: This class allows for operations involving hyperplanes, specifically calculating the points that lie between two given hyperplanes.
- **Result Visualisation**:

### 3. PointCloudProcessor
- **File**: `PointCloudProcessor.py`
- **Description**: This class handles the processing of point clouds to separate objects into top and bottom parts based on the z-value of the middle section.
- **Result Visualisation**:
